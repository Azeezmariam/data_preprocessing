### **Dataset Overview**  
This project involves preprocessing a dataset to prepare it for machine learning or data analysis. The dataset provides detailed records and is designed to address specific analytical or predictive needs.  

---

### **Data Types**  
The dataset contains the following data types:  
- **Categorical:** Describes groups or categories.  
- **Numerical:** Includes both discrete and continuous values.  
- **Temporal:** Represents time-based information, if applicable.  

---

### **Preprocessing Steps**  

#### 1. **Feature Extraction**  
- Identified relevant features for analysis.  
- Generated new features based on existing columns to enhance predictive power.  

#### 2. **Handling Missing Data**  
- Identified columns with missing values.  
- Applied strategies such as imputation or deletion to address the issue.  

#### 3. **Handling Outliers**  
- Detected anomalies using statistical methods or visualization tools.  
- Replaced or removed outliers to ensure data consistency.  

#### 4. **Data Transformation**  
- Scaled numerical features for uniformity.  
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical formats.  
- Applied additional transformations, such as normalization or log scaling, where necessary.  

#### 5. **Data Storage**  
- Saved the cleaned and transformed dataset for future use.  
- Ensured compatibility with downstream tasks by using appropriate file formats.

### **Future Improvements**  
- Implement advanced feature engineering techniques.  
- Use domain knowledge to refine preprocessing strategies.  
- Explore automation of the preprocessing pipeline for scalability.
